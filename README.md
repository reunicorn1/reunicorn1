Software Engineer, Graphic Designer and a Dentist

Currently I'm diving into the intersection of technology, creativity and community! I also work as a front-end developer and designer at [Diaminate](https://diaminate.com), where I help figure out interesting ways to explore scalability and solutions to answer business questions through data and AI.
